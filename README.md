# 0xsersif — Production-Focused Full-Stack Engineer

> I build systems people actually use. Not demos. Not tutorials. Real deployments.

## 🚀 Proof I Ship

### 🏁 Run1Events Platform
**Live:** https://run1events.com  

Built and deployed a real race registration system used in production.

**Results**
- 800 real registrations processed
- Live database + backend handling users
- Production deployment + uptime monitoring
- Full stack built and maintained solo

This is not a sample project.  
This is a live system handling real users.

## 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

- Production > prototypes  
- Metrics > claims  
- Systems > scripts  
- Shipping > perfection  
- Real users > fake demos  

If it’s not deployed, tested, and used — it doesn’t count.
